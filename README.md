# ServiceStartsNow - Import Sets supercharged with Scripted REST

Welcome, this repo hosts the ServiceNow code for my example of Scripted REST being utilized along side Import Sets in the ServiceNow platform.
This was created for sharing during the 2018 ServiceNow Knowledge Conference - CreatorCon CCB0118 session.

We will outline installation and usage steps. You can also find information and walk-through on my blog [ServiceStartsNow.com](https://servicestartsnow.com/category/project/scripted-rest-in-import-sets/)
